# Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, make sure you have:
- Updated all wedding details in `_config.yml`
- Added all your photos to `assets/images/`
- Set up your Formspree form for RSVPs
- Tested the site locally

## Local Testing

Before deploying, test your site locally:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd /Users/steph/wedding-website

# Install dependencies (first time only)
bundle install

# Run local server
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Open in browser
# Visit: http://localhost:4000
```

Press `Ctrl + C` to stop the server.

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: GitHub Pages (Free, Easiest for Jekyll)

#### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com and sign in (or create account)
2. Click "New repository" (+ icon, top right)
3. Repository name: `your-wedding-website` (or any name)
4. Keep it Public (or Private if you have GitHub Pro)
5. Don't initialize with README
6. Click "Create repository"

#### Step 2: Push Your Code

Open Terminal and run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/steph/wedding-website

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make first commit
git commit -m "Initial wedding website"

# Add remote repository (replace USERNAME and REPO-NAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO-NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" tab
3. Click "Pages" in left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select:
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
5. Click "Save"
6. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
7. Your site will be live at: `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/`

#### Step 4: Custom Domain (Optional)

If you bought a custom domain (e.g., stephen-and-stephanie.com):

**In GitHub:**
1. Go to Settings â†’ Pages
2. Enter your custom domain
3. Check "Enforce HTTPS"
4. Save

**With Your Domain Provider:**

For apex domain (stephen-and-stephanie.com):
```
A Record: @ â†’ 185.199.108.153
A Record: @ â†’ 185.199.109.153
A Record: @ â†’ 185.199.110.153
A Record: @ â†’ 185.199.111.153
```

For www subdomain:
```
CNAME Record: www â†’ USERNAME.github.io
```

Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation.

### Option 2: Netlify (Easiest Overall, Best Forms)

#### Why Netlify?
- Free tier is generous
- Built-in form handling (no Formspree needed)

- Continuous deployment

#### Step 1: Create Netlify Account

1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Sign up (can use GitHub account)

#### Step 2: Deploy Your Site

**Method A: Git-based (Recommended)**

1. Push your code to GitHub (see GitHub instructions above)
2. In Netlify, click "New site from Git"
3. Choose "GitHub" and authorize
4. Select your repository
5. Build settings:
   - Build command: `jekyll build`
   - Publish directory: `_site`
6. Click "Deploy site"

**Method B: Drag & Drop**

1. In Netlify, go to Sites

Netlify has built-in form handling:

1. Update `pages/rsvp.html`:
   ```html
   <form name="rsvp" method="POST" data-netlify="true">
   ```

2. That's it! Forms will appear in Netlify dashboard
3. Set up email notifications in Netlify Settings

#### Step 4: Custom Domain

1. Buy domain from Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.
2. In Netlify: Site settings â†’ Domain management
3. Click "Add custom domain"
4. Follow instructions to update DNS

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on GitHub Pages

**Issue:** Site shows error or doesn't build

**Solution:**
- Check `_config.yml` syntax (proper YAML indentation)
- Remove any plugins not supported by GitHub Pages
- Check GitHub Pages build log in Actions tab

### Images Don't Load After Deployment

**Issue:** Images work locally but not online

**Solution 1:** Check `_config.yml` baseurl
```yaml
baseurl: "/your-repo-name"  # If deployed to username.github.io/repo-name
baseurl: ""                  # If deployed to custom domain or username.github.io
```

**Solution 2:** Use proper Liquid syntax
```liquid
{{ '/assets/images/photo.jpg' | relative_url }}
```

### Form Submissions Not Received

**Formspree:**
- Verify form ID is correct
- Check Formspree dashboard
- Confirm email in Formspree settings

**Netlify Forms:**
- Check Netlify dashboard â†’ Forms tab
- Verify `data-netlify="true"` attribute is present
- Test in production (forms don't work on localhost)

### Site Loads Slowly

**Solutions:**
- Compress images (use TinyPNG.com)
- Enable Netlify/Vercel CDN (automatic)
- Reduce image file sizes to < 500KB
- Use WebP format for images

### Custom Domain Not Working

**Check:**
- DNS records are correct
- Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
- Check domain registrar settings
- Verify CNAME file (GitHub Pages)
- Check Netlify/Vercel domain settings

---

## Security Best Practices

- âœ… Use HTTPS (automatic with Netlify/Vercel/GitHub Pages)
- âœ… Don't commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- âœ… Use environment variables for API keys
- âœ… Keep dependencies updated
- âœ… Use strong passwords for accounts

---

## Monitoring & Analytics (Optional)

### Add Google Analytics

1. Create Google Analytics account
2. Get tracking ID (G-XXXXXXXXXX)
3. Add to `_includes/head.html` before `</head>`:

```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

### Netlify Analytics

Built-in analytics available in Netlify dashboard (paid feature).
