          <h3>How We Met</h3>
          <p class="timeline-date">Spring 2020</p>
          <p>
            Our paths first crossed at a church small group gathering. From the moment we met,
            there was an instant connection—a shared passion for faith, service, and meaningful conversations
            that lasted well into the evening. What started as a friendship quickly grew into something more special.

          <h3>Our First Date</h3>
          <p class="timeline-date">Summer 2020</p>
          <p>
            Our first official date was a simple walk through the botanical gardens. We talked for hours,
            discovering shared dreams and values. The olive trees in the garden seemed to whisper peace over us,
            and we both knew this was the beginning of something beautiful. By the end of the day,
            we didn't want to say goodbye.

          <h3>Growing Together in Faith</h3>
          <p class="timeline-date">2021-2023</p>
          <p>
            Over the next few years, we grew not just as a couple, but in our faith. We served together
            in ministry, prayed through challenges, and celebrated victories. We learned what it means to
            put God at the center of our relationship, and our love deepened with every season.
            We knew we were meant to walk this journey together.

          <h3>The Proposal</h3>
          <p class="timeline-date">December 2024</p>
          <p>
            On a crisp winter evening, Stephen planned a surprise return to the botanical gardens where we had our first date.
            Under a canopy of twinkling lights and surrounded by olive branches, he got down on one knee and asked
            Stephanie to be his wife. Through joyful tears, she said yes! It was the perfect moment—
            romantic, intimate, and exactly where our story began.

          <p>
            As we prepare to say "I do," we are filled with gratitude and excitement. We can't wait to celebrate
            this milestone with our loved ones and begin our married life together. With God's grace,
            we look forward to building a home filled with faith, love, laughter, and service.
            Our greatest adventure is just beginning.
