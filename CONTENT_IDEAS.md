## Our Story - Writing Tips

### How We Met
- Where were you? (Church, coffee shop, mutual friend's party?)
- What was your first impression?
- What drew you to each other?
- Any funny or memorable moments?

Example:
> "We met at a church young adults gathering in the spring of 2020. Stephen was the guy making everyone laugh with his terrible puns, and Stephanie was the one brave enough to laugh at them. By the end of the evening, we'd talked for hours about everything from our favorite worship songs to our shared love of hiking."

### First Date
- Where did you go?
- What did you do?
- What made it special?
- When did you know there was something special?

Example:
> "For our first date, Stephen suggested a walk through the botanical gardens. We spent three hours wandering through the olive groves and rose gardens, talking about our dreams, our faith, and our families. The conversation flowed so naturally that we completely lost track of time. By sunset, we both knew this was the beginning of something beautiful."

### Growing Together
- How did your relationship deepen?
- What challenges did you face?
- How did you serve together?
- What activities do you enjoy together?

Example:
> "Over the next few years, we grew together through every season. We served in the church youth ministry, went on hiking adventures, and supported each other through career changes and family challenges. Through it all, we learned to pray together, laugh together, and lean on God when things got tough. Our relationship was built on a foundation of faith, friendship, and mutual respect."

### The Proposal
- Where and when did it happen?
- What was the setup?
- What did you say?
- How did you react?
- Who knew about it beforehand?

Example:
> "On a crisp December evening, Stephen convinced Stephanie they were meeting friends for dinner. Instead, he brought her back to the botanical gardens where they'd had their first date. He'd worked with the staff to set up a private area with twinkling lights and olive branches. As they walked through the garden, photos from their relationship were displayed along the path. At the end, Stephen got down on one knee and asked Stephanie to be his wife. Through happy tears, she said yes! (And yes, their 'dinner friends' were actually hiding nearby with a photographer to capture it all!)"
